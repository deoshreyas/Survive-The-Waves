# Survive-The-Waves

## :zap: About
This is a very small, but fun, game I made to experiment with creating an infinite wave surivivng game using the Godot game engine. It has cool power-ups, multiple enemies, exciting graphics and cool music!

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
I have not yet exported the project. So you'll need to run it using the Godot engine itself. Just clone the repository and import `project.godot` into the engine!

## :grey_question: Controls
- Move around with the left, right and up arrow keys (or `W`, `A`, `S` or `D`)
- Click to shoot!
- Avoid enemies at all costs!
